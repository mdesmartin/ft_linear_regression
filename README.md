# ft_linear_regression

ft_linear_regression is a project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum, focusing on implementing linear regression algorithms from scratch. The project emphasizes understanding and applying statistical and machine learning techniques to model and predict data trends.

## Key Features:

-	Linear Regression Model: Implements a basic linear regression model to predict outcomes based on input features.
-	Data Fitting: Includes functionality for fitting the model to data, optimizing parameters, and making predictions.
-	Cost Function: Utilizes cost functions to measure and minimize prediction errors during training.
-	Visualization: Provides tools to visualize data, regression lines, and model performance.
-	Evaluation Metrics: Implements evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model.

*By working on ft_linear_regression, you will gain practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, understanding data fitting, and evaluating model performance.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a production-grade machine learning library.
